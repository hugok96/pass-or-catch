# Pokémon Pass or Catch

This is a "pass or catch" game built in Angular, with Pokémon data retrieved from an external API, using a Tinder-like
voting system.

## How to use

Download the source code in this repository, install dependencies using `npm install` and either serve it as a
development build using the Angular CLI command `ng serve`, or build it using the Angular CLI command `ng build`.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out
the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## TODOS

- Add documentation to code, specifically for voting and stat system
- Refactor / cleanup
